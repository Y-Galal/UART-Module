# Universal Asynchrounous Receiver Transmitter (UART) Module
#### Implementing a simple UART module using Verilog HDL. The project contains 2 small modules (transmitter and receiver) and the top module that contains both of them. Every module has a separate testbench to make sure that it works correctly.
